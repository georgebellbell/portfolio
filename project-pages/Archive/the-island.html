Using Unity's terrain tool I created a detailed island with features galore. I also created a custom water shader that used gerstner waves and sea foam based on depth to help flesh out the environment. There are a range of other features in the scene like lens flares, moveable camera and varois post processing effects. Please watch the video or check the code if you are interested in learning more about the scene!</div>
