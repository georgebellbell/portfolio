          <div class="body-text">For a team project in my final year, I have been working in a team of 8 people to develop a Splatoon style shooter.</div>
          <div class="body-text">The main objective of the game is to cover as much of the floor in your teams paint colour before the time runs out. It includes a myriad of features:</div>
          <ul> 
            <li>Dynamic painting</li>
            <li>Online multiplayer</li>
            <li>Up to 4 player local play, done via split screen</li>
            <li>Minimap, scorebar and other UI elements</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="bolded">What I developed</div>
          <div class="body-text">My main role focused around Graphics and UI, handling a lot of the rendering and visuals of the game, as well as presenting key information to the player. Here are some of the features I developed:</div>
          <ul> 
            <li>Developed the visuals of the painting effect and how they are drawn to the screen</li>
            <li>Split screen, renders the scene from different perspectives and presents them all to the screen, up to and including 4 players</li>
            <li>Calculating each teams score by updating a map texture when paintballs impact through the use of the GPU and atomics.</li>
            <li>Generating a minimap by sampling the map texture with the up to date splats</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="body-text">I also had the opportunity to improve rendering and optimise performance with the use of features like uniform buffer objects and bindless textures</div>
          <div class="body-text">This project has provided me a great many opportunities to explore areas of game development that interest me, from gameplay to graphics and UI. The UI elements I was able to develop were particularly interesting to me, and is something I would look to develop further in the future.</div>
