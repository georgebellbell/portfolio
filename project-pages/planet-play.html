          <div class="body-text">Completed during my third year using the game engine Unity, I developed a multi-leveled and progressable 3D planet jumping game. I achieved a grade of 88% for this project.</div>
          <div class="body-text">Rather than using all of the physics system provided by Unity, I decided to challenge myself by implementing my own method for gravity to replicate the feel of one of my favourite games, Super Mario Galaxy, with small planets you can run completely around.</div>
          <div class="body-text">This project allowed me to explore several different concepts and features for the game. There were several different planets in the game with different challenges on each, which in addition to different sizes and masses, creates a unique experience on each level via a planet class system. Due to the unique level design of the spherical worlds, the basic navmesh and pathfinding used by Unity would not work so I develop my own pathfinding system that used A* in combination with node generation across the surface of the planet to give intelligence to certain opponents.</div>

              This is where the images in the gallery live. Here's a simple gallery image for you to copy:

              Full Width Image:

                  <img src="../assets/images/IMAGE_NAME" class="gallery-image">

              Half Width Image: 

                <div class="gallery-image-container half-width">
                  <img src="../assets/images/IMAGE_NAME" class="gallery-image">

                </div>

              - To add an image to the this area, copy one of the above, paste it below this comment, and change the following:
                  - IMAGE_NAME: the name of the image file in assets/images
                  - IMAGE_CAPTION: to the caption of the image
